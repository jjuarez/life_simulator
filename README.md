# Life Simulator

This is the implemtation for tuenti SRE position test project. This implementation has completely developed in ruby language,
so you need to consider some thins before execute it.


## Installation

- You need a fresh ruby install, I recomend you a RMI manager like RVM o rbenv
- You have to install bundler gem, which is the dependency manager for the project 
- Execute this command to resolve and intall dependencies: "bundle install"
- Execute the test set with: "rake"
- You can change the behaviour of the world changing the configuration file

##Â TODO

- Improve the test coberture (of course, this is only a hack)
